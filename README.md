# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
This program makes a comparision between the heuristic method and the exact method in terms of cost and execution time in resolving the Travelling Salesman Problem.
This program was implemented in the context of the practical work for the TPRO module (Programming Theory).
To run this code:
   Navigate to the directory where the TP4.py file is located.
   Run the following command: py TP4.py.
   You will see the graphical interface of the program.
   Enter the name of your nodes separated with a space, ex: A B C.
   Enter the edges of the graph separated with a space, ex: A B A C B C, the edges in the example are: AB AC BC.
   enEnterter the cost in each edge separated with a space, ex: 1 2 3 for the example's graph.
   Click to draw the graph.
   Enter the starting node, and click to view the result of the heuristic method or the result of the exact method.
